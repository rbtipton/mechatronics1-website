                </ul>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The correct answer is <b>b) Mechanical, Electrical, Computer Control</b>. Mechatronics is fundamentally defined by the integration of these three fields.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <div class="question-card">
                <p class="question-text">
                    2. True or False: A "systems approach" in mechatronics encourages engineers to design and analyze components in isolation to prevent integration issues.
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The correct answer is <b>False</b>. A systems approach emphasizes considering the interactions between components to optimize the overall system, not isolating them.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <div class="question-card">

                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The correct answer is <b>less / smaller</b>. Connecting resistors in parallel provides multiple paths for current, effectively reducing the total resistance.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <div class="question-card">

                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The correct answer is <b>oppose / resist</b>. Inductors resist changes in current, which is why they store energy in a magnetic field.</p>

                    <p>A debounce routine is a software or hardware technique used to eliminate false readings from mechanical switches. When a mechanical switch is pressed or released, its contacts "bounce" for a short period, creating multiple rapid ON/OFF transitions instead of a single clean transition. Debouncing ensures that the microcontroller registers only one stable press or release event, preventing erratic behavior. It's necessary because microcontrollers are fast enough to detect these rapid bounces, which would be misinterpreted as multiple presses.</p>

                    <p>If the diode were replaced by an ideal wire, its voltage drop would become 0 V. The entire supply voltage (12 V) would then drop across the 1.8 k&Omega; resistor.

It achieves bidirectional control by having four switching elements (e.g., MOSFETs or transistors) arranged in an "H" configuration. By selectively turning ON pairs of switches, current can be directed through the motor in either direction. For example, turning on the top-left and bottom-right switches allows current to flow one way, while turning on the top-right and bottom-left switches reverses the current flow, thus reversing the motor's direction.</p>

                    <p>For an ideal non-inverting Op-Amp configuration, the output voltage is given by the formula:
                    <pre>V<sub>out</sub> = V<sub>in</sub> * (1 + R<sub>f</sub> / R<sub>1</sub>)
V<sub>out</sub> = 0.5 V * (1 + 18 k&Omega; / 2 k&Omega;)
V<sub>out</sub> = 0.5 V * (1 + 9)
V<sub>out</sub> = 0.5 V * 10
V<sub>out</sub> = 5 V</pre>
