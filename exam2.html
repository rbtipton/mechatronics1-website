                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>In digital systems, logical '1' and '0' states are typically represented by two discrete voltage levels, commonly referred to as HIGH and LOW, respectively.</p>
                </details>

                    <li>d) ASIC</li>
                </ul>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The correct answer is <b>b) Microcontroller</b>. Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications where a compact, self-contained computing solution is needed.</p>

                <p class="question-text">
                    3. What is the primary role of the `setup()` function in an Arduino sketch, and how does it differ from the `loop()` function?
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The `setup()` function in an Arduino sketch is used for initialization tasks that need to run only once when the program starts. This includes setting pin modes (INPUT/OUTPUT), initializing serial communication, and setting up initial variable values. The `loop()` function, in contrast, contains the main program logic that runs continuously and repeatedly after `setup()` has completed.</p>
                </details>

                <p class="question-text">
                    4. An Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) serves what fundamental purpose in a mechatronic system?
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>An ADC's fundamental purpose is to convert continuous, real-world analog signals (like temperature, pressure, or light intensity) into discrete digital values that a microcontroller or digital system can understand and process.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 5 -->
            <div class="question-card">
                <p class="question-text">
                    5. Explain how Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) can be used to achieve an effect similar to an analog output from a digital pin.

                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>PWM approximates an analog output by rapidly switching a digital signal (e.g., 5V or 0V) ON and OFF at a high frequency. By varying the "duty cycle" (the proportion of ON time to the total period), the average voltage output changes. For example, a 50% duty cycle on a 5V signal will yield an average of 2.5V, effectively simulating an analog voltage.</p>

                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The correct answer is <b>c) Conditional statements (e.g., `if`, `else if`, `else`)</b>. These statements control the flow of execution based on the evaluation of boolean expressions.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The correct answer is <b>c) `do-while` loop</b>. The `do-while` loop executes its block of code at least once before checking the condition, making it suitable for scenarios where an initial execution is always required.</p>
                </details>

                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>Breaking down a large program into smaller, reusable functions offers several advantages:
                        <br>1.  <b>Modularity:</b> Each function performs a specific task, making the code easier to understand and manage.
                        <br>2.  <b>Reusability:</b> Functions can be called multiple times from different parts of the program, reducing code duplication.
                        <br>3.  <b>Readability:</b> Well-named functions make the program's logic clearer.
                        <br>4.  <b>Debugging:</b> Isolating issues to specific functions simplifies the debugging process.
                        <br>5.  <b>Collaboration:</b> Multiple developers can work on different functions simultaneously.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The primary function of a Data Acquisition (DAQ) system is to collect real-world physical signals (e.g., temperature, pressure, force) from sensors, convert these analog signals into digital data, and then process, analyze, or store this digital information, often for monitoring or control purposes.</p>
                </details>

                <p class="question-text">
                    10. According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, if an analog signal has a maximum frequency component of $F_{max}$, what is the minimum sampling rate required to avoid aliasing?
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, the minimum sampling rate (often called the Nyquist rate) must be at least <b>twice</b> the highest frequency component ($F_{max}$) of the analog signal. So, Sampling Rate $\ge 2 \times F_{max}$.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>An <b>analog signal</b> is continuous and can take on any value within a given range, often varying smoothly over time (e.g., temperature, sound waves). A <b>digital signal</b> is discrete, meaning it can only take on a finite number of distinct values, typically represented by binary states (e.g., HIGH/LOW, 1/0).</p>

                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The <b>resolution</b> of an ADC refers to the smallest change in the analog input voltage that can be detected and converted into a unique digital output value. It is determined by the number of bits the ADC uses (e.g., an 8-bit ADC has 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 discrete levels). Higher resolution means finer granularity in the conversion.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>Pull-up or pull-down resistors are used to ensure that a microcontroller input pin has a defined logical state (HIGH or LOW) when a switch is open. Without them, the pin would be "floating" and susceptible to electrical noise, leading to unpredictable readings. A pull-up resistor connects the pin to VCC (HIGH), while a pull-down resistor connects it to GND (LOW).</p>

                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>A `while` loop is more appropriate when the number of iterations is not known beforehand, and the loop needs to continue as long as a certain condition remains true. For example, reading a sensor until a specific threshold is reached, or waiting for a serial input character. A `for` loop is typically used when the number of iterations is fixed or predetermined.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>Baud rate in serial communication refers to the rate at which information is transferred in symbols per second. In simple terms, it's the speed of data transmission. For successful communication between two devices (e.g., Arduino and a computer's Serial Monitor), both must be configured to the same baud rate, otherwise, the data will be corrupted and unreadable.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>Sampling rate is the number of samples taken per second from a continuous analog signal to convert it into a discrete digital signal. It is crucial because if the sampling rate is too low (less than twice the highest frequency in the signal, as per Nyquist-Shannon theorem), a phenomenon called "aliasing" occurs, where higher frequencies in the original signal appear as lower, incorrect frequencies in the sampled data, leading to distorted or inaccurate representation.</p>

                    <p>A Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) converts digital signals (e.g., from a microcontroller) back into analog signals (e.g., varying voltage or current). Its role is to provide a continuous, real-world output from digital instructions. An example application is controlling the speed of a DC motor with variable voltage, where the microcontroller outputs digital values that the DAC converts into a smooth analog voltage to drive the motor.</p>

                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>"Mapping" or "scaling" in programming refers to the process of converting a range of input values from one scale to a corresponding range of output values on another scale. This is essential when a sensor (e.g., an analog temperature sensor) outputs values in one range (e.g., 0-1023 from an ADC), but an actuator (e.g., an LED brightness control) requires values in a different range (e.g., 0-255 for PWM). Mapping ensures the sensor's input can effectively control the actuator's behavior.</p>

                    <p>First, identify the mapping ranges:
                    <br>Input range for linear mapping: [201, 1023]
                    <br>Output range for linear mapping: [0, 255]
                    <br><br>The length of the input range is 1023 - 201 = 822.
                    <br>The length of the output range is 255 - 0 = 255.
                    <br><br>The sensor reading is 612. Since 612 is within the 201-1023 range, we apply linear mapping.
                    <br><br>The formula for linear mapping from one range to another is:
                    <pre>Output = (Input - Input<sub>min</sub>) * (Output<sub>max</sub> - Output<sub>min</sub>) / (Input<sub>max</sub> - Input<sub>min</sub>) + Output<sub>min</sub></pre>
                    <p>In this case:
                    <pre>Input = 612
Input<sub>min</sub> = 201
Input<sub>max</sub> = 1023
Output<sub>min</sub> = 0
Output<sub>max</sub> = 255</pre>
                    <p>Calculation:
                    <pre>Fan Speed = (612 - 201) * (255 - 0) / (1023 - 201) + 0
Fan Speed = 411 * 255 / 822
Fan Speed = 104805 / 822
Fan Speed &approx; 127.5</pre>
                    <p>Since fan speed is typically an integer, round to the nearest whole number.
                    <pre>Fan Speed = 128</pre>
                    <p>Therefore, if the sensor reads a value of 612, the mapped fan speed level should be <b>128</b>.</p>
