                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>Mapping (or scaling) in Arduino refers to converting a value from one range of numbers to another range. For analog sensor readings, this is often used to transform the raw ADC values (e.g., 0-1023) into a more meaningful physical unit or a different output range (e.g., 0-255 for LED brightness, or actual temperature in Celsius). The `map()` function in Arduino is commonly used for this purpose.</p>

                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>A microcontroller is designed for specific control tasks in embedded systems, typically with limited resources (CPU, memory) and optimized for real-time interaction with hardware.

                    <p>A "floating" digital input pin is one that is not connected to a defined voltage (HIGH or LOW). Such a pin is highly susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI) or static electricity, causing it to randomly switch between HIGH and LOW states. This unpredictable behavior can lead to erroneous readings and unintended actions in a microcontroller program. Pull-up or pull-down resistors are used to prevent floating states.</p>

                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>First, find the analog voltage corresponding to the digital reading:</p>
                    <pre>ADC Resolution = 5.0 V / 1024 &approx; 0.0048828 V/step
Analog Voltage = Digital Reading * ADC Resolution
Analog Voltage = 512 * 0.0048828 V &approx; 2.5 V</pre>
                    <p>Next, use the sensor's transfer function to find the temperature. The sensor range is 3.0 V - 0.5 V = 2.5 V for 100¬∞C.
                    <br>Sensor sensitivity = 2.5 V / 100¬∞C = 0.025 V/¬∞C.
                    <br>The voltage measured is 2.5 V, which is 2.5 V - 0.5 V = 2.0 V above the 0¬∞C reading.
                    <pre>Temperature = (Analog Voltage - V<sub>min_sensor</sub>) / Sensor Sensitivity
Temperature = (2.5 V - 0.5 V) / 0.025 V/¬∞C
Temperature = 2.0 V / 0.025 V/¬∞C = 80 ¬∞C</pre>
                    <p>Therefore, the temperature is <b>80 ¬∞C</b>.</p>
