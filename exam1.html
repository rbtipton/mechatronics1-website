            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <div class="question-card">
                <p class="question-text">
                    1. What interdisciplinary field focuses on the synergistic integration of mechanical engineering, electronics, and computer control to design and manufacture products and processes?
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The correct answer is <b>Mechatronics</b>. This field combines these three core disciplines to create integrated, intelligent systems.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <div class="question-card">
                <p class="question-text">
                    2. Explain why a "holistic" or "systems approach" is crucial in mechatronics design, contrasting it with a component-by-component optimization strategy.
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>A holistic systems approach is crucial because mechatronic systems involve tightly integrated components (mechanical, electrical, software) where the behavior of one significantly impacts others. Optimizing components in isolation often leads to suboptimal overall system performance, unforeseen interactions, or even system failure. A systems approach considers these interactions from the outset, leading to more efficient, reliable, and effective designs.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <div class="question-card">
                <p class="question-text">
                    3. Describe the fundamental role of a resistor in an electrical circuit and how it achieves this function.
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The fundamental role of a resistor in an electrical circuit is to oppose or limit the flow of electric current. It achieves this by converting some of the electrical energy into heat, thereby reducing the current that can pass through a given voltage difference.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <div class="question-card">
                <p class="question-text">
                    4. How does a capacitor behave in a direct current (DC) circuit once it has accumulated its maximum charge?
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>Once a capacitor is fully charged in a DC circuit, it acts as an open circuit, meaning it blocks the flow of direct current. It maintains a constant voltage across its plates equal to the source voltage, and no more current flows through it from the DC source.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 5 -->
            <div class="question-card">
                <p class="question-text">
                    5. Explain the phenomenon that occurs when the current through an inductor changes rapidly, and what principle governs the direction of the induced voltage.
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>When the current through an inductor changes rapidly, the inductor generates a voltage (electromotive force, EMF) across itself. This induced voltage always opposes the change in current that caused it, a principle known as Lenz's Law. This opposition is due to the inductor's property of storing energy in a magnetic field, and it resists changes to that stored energy.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 6 -->
            <div class="question-card">
                <p class="question-text">
                    6. Describe the conditions under which a semiconductor P-N junction diode permits significant current flow, and what happens to the depletion region during this state.
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>A semiconductor P-N junction diode permits significant current flow when it is "forward biased." This occurs when a positive voltage is applied to the P-type side and a negative voltage to the N-type side, which reduces the width of the depletion region. The reduced depletion region allows charge carriers (electrons and holes) to easily cross the junction, leading to a large current.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 7 -->
            <div class="question-card">
                <p class="question-text">
                    7. What is the defining characteristic of a diode's behavior regarding the direction of current flow in an electrical circuit?
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The defining characteristic of a diode's behavior is that it allows current to flow predominantly in only one direction (unidirectional flow) while blocking or severely limiting current flow in the opposite direction.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 8 -->
            <div class="question-card">
                <p class="question-text">
                    8. List three ideal characteristics of an Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp) and explain why these are difficult to achieve perfectly in practical devices.
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>Three ideal characteristics of an Op-Amp are:
                        <br>1.  <b>Infinite Input Impedance:</b> An ideal Op-Amp draws no current from its input terminals. In practice, Op-Amps have very high, but finite, input impedance due to the internal circuitry (e.g., MOSFETs or BJTs).
                        <br>2.  <b>Zero Output Impedance:</b> An ideal Op-Amp can supply any amount of current to the load without any voltage drop across its output. Real Op-Amps have a small, but non-zero, output impedance which causes a slight voltage drop under load.
                        <br>3.  <b>Infinite Open-Loop Gain:</b> An ideal Op-Amp would have an infinitely large voltage amplification without feedback. Practical Op-Amps have a very high, but finite, open-loop gain (e.g., 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup>).
                        <br>These are difficult to achieve perfectly due to physical limitations of semiconductor materials, manufacturing processes, and the need for internal components that consume power and have inherent resistances/capacitances.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 9 -->
            <div class="question-card">
                <p class="question-text">
                    9. Fill-in-the-Blank: The term ________ refers to how close a measurement is to the true value, while ________ describes the degree to which repeated measurements under the same conditions show the same results.
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The correct answer is <b>Accuracy, precision</b>. Accuracy relates to correctness, while precision relates to consistency.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 10 -->
            <div class="question-card">
                <p class="question-text">
                    10. Which of the following attributes is an example of a *static* characteristic of a measurement system?
                </p>
                <ul class="options-list">
                    <li>a) Rise time</li>
                    <li>b) Settling time</li>
                    <li>c) Sensitivity</li>
                    <li>d) Frequency response</li>
                </ul>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The correct answer is <b>c) Sensitivity</b>. Static characteristics describe the performance of a measurement system when the input is constant or changing very slowly. Rise time, settling time, and frequency response are all dynamic characteristics.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- New Conceptual Question 11 -->
            <div class="question-card">
                <p class="question-text">
                    11. What is the primary advantage of integrating computer control into mechanical and electronic systems in a mechatronic design?
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The primary advantage is the ability to achieve intelligent, adaptive, and autonomous behavior. Computer control allows for complex decision-making, real-time adjustments, data processing, and communication, leading to systems that are more efficient, precise, and versatile than purely mechanical or electronic systems.</p>

                    <p>A common example is an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) in a car.
                        <br><b>Mechanical:</b> Brake calipers, brake pads, rotors, wheels.
                        <br><b>Electronic:</b> Wheel speed sensors, solenoid valves, electronic control unit (ECU) circuitry.
                        <br><b>Computer Control:</b> The ECU's microcontroller runs algorithms that monitor wheel speed, detect wheel lock-up, and rapidly modulate brake pressure via the solenoid valves to prevent skidding and maintain steering control.</p>

                <p class="question-text">
                    13. How does the resistance of a typical conductor change as its temperature increases?
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>For most metallic conductors, the resistance increases as its temperature increases. This is because higher temperatures cause increased thermal vibrations of atoms, which impede the flow of electrons more effectively.</p>

                    14. What is the main difference in energy storage between a capacitor and an inductor?
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>A capacitor stores energy in an electric field between its plates, while an inductor stores energy in a magnetic field created by the current flowing through its coil.</p>
                </details>

            <!-- New Conceptual Question 15 -->

                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>Immediately after a DC voltage source is connected to a series RL circuit, the inductor acts like an open circuit (or very high resistance) because it opposes the sudden change in current. Therefore, the current starts at zero and gradually increases exponentially towards its steady-state value (V/R) as the inductor's magnetic field builds up.</p>
                </details>

                <p class="question-text">
                    16. What is the "knee voltage" or "cut-in voltage" of a diode, and why is it significant in circuit analysis?
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The "knee voltage" (or cut-in voltage/forward voltage drop) is the minimum forward-bias voltage required across a diode for it to begin conducting significant current. For silicon diodes, it's typically around 0.7 V, and for germanium, it's about 0.3 V. It's significant because it must be overcome by the applied voltage for the diode to function as a switch or rectifier in a circuit.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>Negative feedback in Op-Amp circuits is used to stabilize the gain, reduce distortion, increase bandwidth, and make the circuit's performance less dependent on the Op-Amp's inherent characteristics (like its very high open-loop gain). It allows for precise control over the amplifier's behavior.</p>

                    <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
                    <p>The "loading effect" occurs when a measurement instrument draws current or power from the circuit or system it is measuring, thereby altering the very quantity it is trying to measure. This leads to an inaccurate reading because the act of measurement itself changes the system's behavior. For example, a voltmeter with low input impedance connected across a high-resistance circuit can significantly alter the voltage it's trying to measure.</p>
